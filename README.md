# Crafting Interpreters
My code for [_Crafting Interpreters_](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). I'm using Kotlin where the book uses Java. We'll see about the C parts. Maybe some Rust?

```bash
# Get the kotlin compiler
brew update
brew install kotlin

# Run a file
make run filename.lox

# Run the prompt
make run-prompt
```
